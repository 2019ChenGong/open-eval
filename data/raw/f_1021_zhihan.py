def f_1021(l1, l2, k=10):
    """
    Interleave two lists, select a random sample from the combined list, and calculate the frequency of each element in the sample.

    This function first interleaves the elements of two input lists, `l1` and `l2`, by alternating between their elements.
    It then selects a random sample of `k` elements from the interleaved list. If the interleaved list's length is less than
    or equal to `k`, each element could be selected multiple times. Finally, it calculates and returns the frequency of each
    element in this sample as a collections.Counter object.

    Parameters:
    - l1 (list of any type): The first list of elements to be interleaved.
    - l2 (list of any type): The second list of elements to be interleaved.
    - k (int, optional): The size of the sample to draw from the combined list. Defaults to 10.

    Returns:
    - collections.Counter: A Counter object representing the frequency of each element in the sample.

    Requirements:
    - The 'collections' module for the Counter class.
    - The 'itertools' module for the 'zip_longest' function to handle lists of unequal length.
    - The 'random' module for the 'choices' function to select the sample.

    Example:
    >>> l1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
    >>> l2 = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
    >>> f_1021(l1, l2)
    Counter({9: 1, 6: 1, 7: 2, 2: 1, 5: 1, 1: 1, 8: 2, 4: 1})
    >>> l1 = [1, 7, 5, 7, 3]
    >>> l2 = [2, 4, 3, 8, 1]
    >>> f_1021(l1, l2)
    Counter({3: 4, 2: 2, 1: 4})

    Note:
    - The 'choices' function allows for the same element to be selected more than once if the sample size 'k' is greater than the
      combined list size, implementing sampling with replacement.
