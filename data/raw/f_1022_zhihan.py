def f_1022(l1, l2):
    """
    This function takes two lists, l1 and l2, as input, combines them by alternating their elements, 
    calculates the absolute difference of each combined element to a predefined threshold, and 
    returns the element that is closest to this threshold.
    
    Parameters:
    l1 (list): The first input list containing numeric values.
    l2 (list): The second input list containing numeric values.
    
    Returns:
    float: The element from the combined list that is closest to the threshold.
    
    Requirements:
    - This function requires the libraries: numpy and itertools.
    
    Example:
    >>> l1 = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
    >>> l2 = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]
    >>> closest = f_1022(l1, l2)
    >>> print(closest)  # Output: 0.5
    
    Notes:
    - The THRESHOLD is predefined and set to 0.5.
    - If the lengths of l1 and l2 are different, the function will still combine them by filling 
      the shorter list with None, which will be filtered out in the combining process.
